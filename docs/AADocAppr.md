# Document Approach
This document follows Alistair Cockburnâ€™s recommendations in Writing Effective Use Cases, Addison-Wesley, 2001.

## Key points
The use cases are well-formed processes and subprocesses, with a purpose, a trigger, a primary actor, some input, and 
some output. 

The happy path is described as steps in the Main Success Scenario, with alternatives and error responses described in
the Extensions. The numbered steps in the Extensions correspond to the MSS steps.

The UI is described elsewhere.
